# Terraform-guide

What is Terraform?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure (servers, databases, networking, etc.) using code — making infrastructure repeatable, consistent, and version-controlled.

⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing infrastructure (like servers, databases, and networks) through code rather than manual processes.

Examples:

AWS → CloudFormation (CFT)

Azure → Resource Manager (ARM templates)

OpenStack → Heat templates

Terraform → Multi-cloud IaC using provider APIs.

🧩 API as Code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

API as Code is a concept that allows automation of cloud resources across multiple providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) using their APIs.

Terraform uses this principle to interact with cloud providers via APIs.

API → Application Programming Interface

Terraform acts as a universal API manager for multiple providers.
